Hi,

This is your second reminder that you have a Nerd Nite mailbox which means that emails sent to you are stored on the nerdnite.com server.

If this email is sitting in your personal inbox, then that means you probably set up a forwarding solution at some point.

PLEASE DON'T IGNORE THIS EMAIL EITHER WAY.

On the 27th of this month, all Nerd Nite mailboxes will be deleted. If you have not worked with me to set up a forwarding soltuion, this will mean

 - You will lose your entire history of Nerd Nite emails
 - Nerd Nite emails sent to you will never arrive and will bounce back to the original sender


This document, http://bit.ly/12SeLT5, lays out all of the changes and how to implement them at your end. 

If any of the directions are unclear or you hit any snags, I'll work with you to sort things out.
 
If you access and send Nerd Nite emails from you phone, let me know what model it is and I can work with you to get that set up. If you use a client other than Thunderbird and need help setting that up, let me know and I can help you with that.
 
As always, any questions you may have, send them my way!
 
Thanks,
 
Dan
