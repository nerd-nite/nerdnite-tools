Hello!

You're getting this email because you have a Nerd Nite mailbox. This means that emails that are sent to this address are stored on the nerdnite.com server.

This is going to be changing.

This document, http://bit.ly/12SeLT5, lays out all of the changes and how to implement them at your end.

I'd like to get through this within 7 days. As such, please note the following:

   *** If I don't hear from you within 7 days, I will delete your mailbox ***
   
The reason for this is that some of the mailboxes are basically dead.
 
That doesn't mean you *have* to make the move within 7 days. If you need time, just let me know within the 7 day period and we can work it out.
 
If any of the directions are unclear or you hit any snags, I'll work with you to sort things out.
 
If you access and send Nerd Nite emails from you phone, let me know what model it is and I can work with you to get that set up. If you use a client other than Thunderbird and need help setting that up, let me know and I can help you with that.
 
As always, any questions you may have, send them my way!
 
Thanks,
 
Dan
