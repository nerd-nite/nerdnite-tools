Hello!

You're getting this email because you have a Nerd Nite mailbox. This means that emails that are sent to this address are stored on the nerdnite.com server.

This is going to be changing.

This document, http://bit.ly/12SeLT5, lays out all of the changes and how to implement them at your end. The goal here is to make nerdnite.com a more reliable and stable platform for Nerd Nite bosses.
It's part of a bunch of things that will be rolled out over the next few months. The goal is to be as transparent as possible but some things, like this, will require your cooperation.

I'd like to get through this within 7 days. That might seem aggressive, but a short sharp push will be much easier than a long, drawn out process.
As such, please note the following:

   *** If I don't hear from you at all within 7 days, I will delete your mailbox ***
   
The reason for this is that some of the mailboxes are basically dead. The only way I can know otherwise is if I hear from you.
 
That doesn't mean you *have* to make the move within 7 days. If you need time, just let me know within the 7 day period and we can work it out.
 
If any of the directions are unclear or you hit any snags, I'll work with you to sort things out.
 
If you access and send Nerd Nite emails from you phone, let me know what model it is and I can work with you to get that set up. If you use a client other than Thunderbird and need help setting that up, let me know and I can help you with that.
 
As always, any questions you may have, send them my way!
 
Thanks,
 
Dan
