Hello {{boss.name}},

You have been added as a boss of the Nerd Nite team in {{city.name}}.

By now, you should have already received an email welcoming you as a Nerd Nite boss.

This email provides some information about the city part of being a boss.

** Email **
There is now an email address, {{city._id}}@nerdnite.com that gets forwarded to you and everyone
else who is a boss with you in your city. You should talk to them about how you would like to handle emails.
The instructions provided with your Boss email account (about sending emails from Thunderbird or iPhone) and 
be slightly modified to bring the same capabilities to your city account.

** WordPress **
Nerd Nite uses WordPress for its city pages. If you have never used WordPress before, reach out
to Dan <dan.rumney@nerdnite.com>, Matt <matt.wasowski@nerdnite.com> or any of the other
bosses <bosses@nerdnite.com> with your questions.

You can log in to your site at http://{{city._id}}.nerdnite.com/wp-admin

Your username and password will be emailed to you separately.

** Mailing List **
Each city has its own mailing list. You can log on to your mailing list at http://nerdnite.com/lists/admin
There's a tutorial about the mailing list here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kKymD5CJv7LPkultFj8lqF0dRAJCtYES-GlmbgKHqQU/edit

As always, you can email me, dan.rumney@nerdnite.com if you have any questions.

Welcome to Nerd Nite!

Dan
