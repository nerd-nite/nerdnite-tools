Greetings {{name}},

This is an email to report on your Nerd Nite email address(es)

Every boss has a canonical email that they can choose to use, or not. Yours is: {{_id}}@nerdnite.com.

Some bosses have aliases that they can also choose to use (or not).
{{#if aliases}}
You have the following: {{#aliases}}
    * {{.}}@nerdnite.com{{/aliases}}
{{else}}
You do not have any.
{{/if}}

Only *you* receive emails sent to the address(es) above.

In addition, you are copied on all emails to the following city email addresses:
{{#if cities}}
{{#cities}}
    * {{.}}@nerdnite.com
{{/cities}}
{{else}}
    * None
{{/if}}

Please take a moment to check and confirm that these are the right addresses.
Is anything missing?
Are you included anywhere you shouldn't be?

Let me know at dan@nerdnite.com and I'll fix it.

Thanks,

Dan
