Greetings Bosses of {{name}},

This is an email to report on your city email address set up. For many of you, this will be the second such email.

I've been making corrections, following some reports of errors, so I'm sending this again to see how things are looking.

The email that we have on record is {{_id}}@nerdnite.com.

{{#if aliases}}
The following email addresses are also set up for this city: {{#aliases}}
    *{{.}}@nerdnite.com{{/aliases}}
{{else}}
No other email addresses are configured for this city.
{{/if}}

This email address forwards to the following addresses: {{#bosses}}
  * {{.}}{{/bosses}}


Please take a moment to check and confirm that these are the right addresses.
Is anyone missing?
Is anyone there, who should not be?
Is anyone duplicated?

Let me know at dan@nerdnite.com and I'll fix it.

Thanks,

Dan
